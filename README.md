## Working with Atom
After years learning emacs, I have decided to move to Atom. It will be a long curve ahead for me, to pick up javascript, node.js, html and CSS but it I am looking forward to it. This is the future. My fascination with editors started with vim to emacs, my love affair with emacs has lasted more than a decade. I occasionally flirted with other IDEs, the longest lasting was Eclipse, but I alway went back to emacs. With things like org-mode which still is not supported in Atom, there was no leaving emacs.
Enjoying the markdown view!


### Getting on with Markdown
I have gotten used to emacs org-mode features that come built in. For markdown on Atom - one needs to pull in lot more features to enable a full featured Markdown support

- markdown-folder
- language-markdown
- markdown-preview-plus : Ctrl-Shift-m
- markdown-table-formatter : Markdown Table Formatter: Enable For Current Scope, this will enable it for the whole file

Table test : The |—| if not given - it doesn’t recognize as a table in markdown-preview-plus

| packages | keys    | Notes |
|:---------|:--------|:------|
| test     | what is | this  |

Working on tables needs more user-friendly support compared to emacs. One has to do Alt-Shit-T after every line.


### Key short cuts and functions
Misbehaving tables!

| Functionality     | Key                       | Function name |
|:------------------|:--------------------------|:--------------|
| emacs column edit |                           |               |
| Pane split        | Ctrl-K up/down/left/right |               |
| Pane move to next | Ctrl-K n                  |               |


## NLTK
Will try to learn Atom and nltk in conjunction.
